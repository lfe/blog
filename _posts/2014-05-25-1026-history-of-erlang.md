For a full understanding of one's field, a thorough knowledge of that field's
origins of that field and its tools is necessary. To encourge a deeper
understanding of Lisp, Erlang, and LFE we have added a new section on the docs
site main page:

 * <a href="http://docs.lfe.io/#History">History</a>

The Erlang history is quite rich and worth the reads (and watches -- video is
included!).

We will add more content here as it is discovered or becomes available.
