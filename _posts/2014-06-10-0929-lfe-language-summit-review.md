<a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/">Erlang Factory</a> was very kind to
assist Robert Virding in setting up the first "language summit" for LFE here at
<a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2014">Erlang User Conference</a>
in Stockholm. (We use the term "summit" playfully, since it's a very unofficial
affair within a small developer community.)

We took notes in an
<a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/lfe-design-summit-euc2014">etherpad</a>,
but below is a review of what we talked about and the general feel of the session.

We had a nice showing of about 15 to 20 folks who were interested in LFE either
as users, developers, language tinkerers, and the curious. The first half of
the talk was dedicated to a discussion on maps and changes to the
<code>lfe</code> executable that will make it more shell-like.

Additional topics covered:

 * A Standard Library for LFE
 * Getting to Types in LFE

Topics we didn't get to but will bring up on the mail list:

 * An Object System for LFE
 * Lazy Evaluation

In general, LFE development is very mellow, done casually in the spare time of
the contributors, completely for the fun of it. It was nice to see that the design
session reflected that same demeanor, that the character didn't change in a larger
group where opinions were being shared. It will be nice to see what the future 
brings for LFE and how this casual approach scales :-)
