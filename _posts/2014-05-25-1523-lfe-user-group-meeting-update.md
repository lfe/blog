As you may have heard, we'll be hosting LFE's first "Language Summit" at the
Erlang User Conference this year in Stockholm. Keep in mind that when we say
"Language Summit", we are using the time-honored tongue-in-cheek method of
making self-deprecatory remarks.

Robert has recently sent the mail list an
