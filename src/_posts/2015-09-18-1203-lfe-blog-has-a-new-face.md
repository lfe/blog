<a href="{{ site.base_url }}/assets/images/posts/Blog-Makeover.png"><img class="left thumb" src="{{ site.base_url }}/assets/images/posts/Blog-Makeover.png" /></a>We've been sitting on this redesign for a while, initially planned for an LFE
docs site refresh (based on the [GitHub docs site design](https://developer.github.com/)).
However, we got tired of waiting around on all the CSS debugging for that
project. The blog site has fewer requirements, so we rolled it out last night.

We've [mentioned it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/oubiwann/status/644754455666147329)
and have [opened some tickets](https://github.com/lfe/blog/issues) for future
improvements and bugs (in fact, we just [closed a bunch](https://github.com/lfe/blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)).
The one we're most interested in getting addressed is the work for making the
blog [mobile accessible](https://github.com/lfe/blog/issues/11).

[Let us know](https://github.com/lfe/blog/issues/new) if you've found any
other issues with the site or have any suggestions to make it better. PR's welcome!
(like the [one we got earlier today!](https://github.com/lfe/blog/pull/9))
