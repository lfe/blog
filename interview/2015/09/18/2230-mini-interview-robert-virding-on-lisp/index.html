you've been watching the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/lisp-flavoured-erlang">LFE mail list closely</a>,
then you will have noticed that we're working on LFE's first book. That's
super-exciting, but for a future post or two all of their own. Several months
ago I was getting chapter 1 ready for the reviewers, and I needed some
clarification on a few points from Robert Virding regarding some of LFE's
historical details.</p>

<p>So I did what was natural: asked a bunch of completely unrelated questions!
Well, to be honest, they were related tangentially and they helped put together
a more complete picture of LFE's early history. It ended up being a bit of a
mini-interview, and I enjoyed Robert's responses so much, I asked him if it was
okay to share with the wider LFE community – he agreed and the plan was
back-burnered for when I had a chance to create a post with the questions and
answers.</p>

<p>Robert and I had a few more related conversations around the same time – I've
taken a bit of artistic liberty in weaving the additional email conversations
into a single narrative.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this as much as I did :-)</p>

<hr />

<p>Duncan: <strong>When did you first encounter Lisp? Where were you working
and/or going to school?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
I first encountered Lisp somewhere around 1980-81. I was in the Physics
department at Stockholm University and had started taking my PhD in theoretical
physics there.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>What was your initial reaction to Lisp?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
They were using it at the department for algebraic calculations in theoretical
physics which is why I came into contact with it. I was (not yet) a part of
that work so, while it was cool, I didn't really see the beauty of it right
away.  At that time I was doing programming of more "normal" types of
applications, tools for student labs and micro-processor programming in labs,
using more traditional languages like Pascal and various assemblers.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>What where the primary hurdles you had to overcome when initially
learning Lisp?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
My major difficulty was in grasping that the parentheses defined a data
structure and were not just for grouping as in other languages. Why wasn't
<code>(foo (1) (2) (3))</code> the same as <code>(foo 1 2 3)</code>. Once I got that, it was
easy. The prefix notation was no problem as I had done some work with Forth
(and had implemented one), so I was used to not having infix operators.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>What projects did you work on where Lisp was a major aspect of the
work?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
I didn't really use Lisp deeply at the Physics department. They had a VAX 780
running VMS and had
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_%28software%29">Eunice</a>, so I tested
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Lisp">Franz Lisp</a>.  When I left and joined
Ericsson they were also using Vax/VMS so I borrowed Eunice to continue with
Lisp. I thought it would be interesting to see if I could port Franz Lisp to
straight-VMS. It was much more UNIX/BSD dependent than I originally thought,
which resulted in me having to implement more of BSD on top of VMS than I had
planned. Maybe I can share those details with you later, they are not really
interesting here, for this Lisp discussion.  As far as I know no-one except me
ever used it, but it did wonders for my C and understanding of how OSes work!</p>

<p>I did more work with Lisp when I was a member of the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817053822/http://www.ericsson.se/cslab/admin/jubileumsskrift.html">Computer Science Lab</a>
in Ericsson where we were looking at various ways of implementing telecom
applications. Lisp was one the languages we were investigating, and as part of
that work I studied implementing Lisps. I also implemented the Lisp Machine
Flavors system as a study of implementing a relatively complex system in and on
Lisp … and for the fun of it as well.</p>

<p>We later moved on to look at logic languages and these became the base on which
Erlang was built, even though Erlang itself became functional.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>Can you tell me more about the Flavors project?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
Well, it's probably not well-known that the name LFE – Lisp Flavoured Erlang
– was partly inspired by the work I did on porting Flavors to VMS, with the
spelling changed to the English "Flavours" as a joke.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>Were you using an LMI Lambda? If it wasn't a
Symbolics machine, then it probably wasn't ZetaLisp … so were you using the
Maclisp-derived Lisp for the Lambda?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
No, it was other way around. I was using PSL
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Standard_Lisp">Portable Standard Lisp</a>)
from Utah which was quite a good Lisp implementation running on UNIX, amongst
other systems. I had heard about Flavors and thought it would be interesting,
and fun, to see if I could implement it on PSL. I managed to get hold of the
Lisp Machine Flavors documentation and got going.</p>

<p>Flavors was an extremely feature-filled system; someone had really gone to town
with it. It had multiple inheritance, mix-in flavors, before and after
handlers, and wrapper macros. It also had a set of rules describing which were
to be called and when. It was wonderful. Fortunately, Flavors had a few
features which made it easier. For example, there was an explicit <code>send</code>
function so I didn't need to hack PSL itself.</p>

<p>All in all, it worked. But I never really had a proper use-case. Unfortunately,
I think the code has disappeared – at least, I haven't been able to find it.
It would almost be doable on LFE except for updating object state; you would
have to modify it to return the new object instead. Or use processes, but then
they may be a little heavy.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>After gaining experience in school and work with Lisp, what features
did you feel made Lisp an excellent tool or even just fun to work with?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
I liked working with functional languages and I found Lisp to be very versatile
when building systems. The combination of functions and macros – and the
homoiconicity which makes working with macros easy – makes Lisp a very
powerful tool. This makes Lisp and the concurrency from Erlang a very good
combination.  One wonders how it would have gone if we had used Lisp as a base
for Erlang.</p>

<p>Duncan: <strong>In 2007, when you started working on what would become LFE, when was
the last time you had implemented a language? Was it in 1986 when you had
implemented the variants of the parallel logic programming languages?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
In addition to the work on the parallel programming languages, I did a number
of implementations of Erlang to study different techniques as well as to study
the possibilities of using different memory management and garbage collection
mechanisms like reference-counting and a real-time copying collector. These
presented no significant benefit over the separate-process-heap model used in
the "standard" Erlang implementations, so the work was discontinued.</p>

<p>I did some work with the BEAM implementation, amongst other things, the
compiler, and also parts of the basic system.</p>

<p>Duncan:
<strong>Coming back to the parallel programming, I saw a reference to the 1986 paper
you co-authored, entitled
<em>The Phoning Philosopher's Problem or Logic Programming for Telecommunications Applications</em>,
where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlog">Parlog</a> was used to create what
looked like an Erlang prototype. Was this the first version of Erlang?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong>:
No, the Erlang language did not exist in 1986; using the name "Erlang"
pre-dates the current Erlang language. The 1986 paper was describing a
language/system based on concurrent logic which we called "Erlang". It
was mainly done by a guy called Nabiel Elshiewy and myself. Actually this path
was abandoned and has nothing to do modern Erlang. Which I think is a great
shame, as I liked the concurrent logic languages. I still do.</p>

<p>Work on what became Erlang didn't really start until '87/'88. Before that
almost all the members of the lab had written telecom applications in a variety
of languages and systems – basically everything that ran on BSD or UNIX – to
experiment with ways of solving the problem.</p>
